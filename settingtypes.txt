## Error correction

# If you know how it happened, please let me know so I can prevent it.

## Gameplay settings

# By default, Exile uses the world seed to generate dye sources. This

# this to use a random seed, so different plants will be chosen each time
# the world seed is used.

## Settings for displays

#  - Progressive is way much slower, but the area is available directly in it's untransformed shape. The nodes will be updated one after the other while the game is rather idle.
