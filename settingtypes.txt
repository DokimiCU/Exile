## Update shape ABM

## Update shape on world generation

# Define which method is used when generating a new area.
#  - VoxelManip (default) is the most efficient one, but the area will be available only once it is completely updated and may be resource intensive. This is the preferred method as map generation is optimized not to impact the game.
#  - Progressive is way much slower, but the area is available directly in it's untransformed shape. The nodes will be updated one after the other while the game is rather idle. This method is preferred on old single core CPU that cannot benefit from map generation optimization, if the areas are too long to emerge or if you like to see mountains smoothing themselves progressively.
