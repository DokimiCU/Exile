ISSUES AND TO DO LIST
----------------------

Exile is a Work in Progress!

This is a working document to keep track of various issues as they arise.
This also lists various ideas, planned, and possible features.



#ISSUES
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Urgent Fixes needed:
-occassional function animals.hq_attack_eat(self,prty,tgtobj) crash . api.lua:387: attempt to perform arithmetic on field 'height' (a nil value).


Climate:
-weather saving would be better done on_leaveplayer (but that doesn't work for some reason...). Being called unnecessarily to work around this
-weather effects if exposed to sun?? ie. so can't dig a massive pit to stop rain.
-sound effects cut off underground is too abrupt (should fade)
-values on inventory page don't update instantly (e.g. when using chat commands)
-settings for season length (longer seasons might be better for servers)

Bed:
-bed rest wipes physics effects (almost a feature...)
-multiplayer bug caused by breaktaker?
-need something to stop beds getting destroyed while a player is one them (a problem for punchable/floodable/buildable sleeping spot)

Health:
-energy can go negative (needs to cap at 0)

Animals:
-some spiders were getting nil energy (from egg spawning? maybe only in dev, not happening now?)
-mobs_chicken_white.png is being called by something (the chicken model itself? Isn't in the code anywhere...)
-stability of animal populations over time unknown
-some animals can be a bit too unintelligent (e.g. hunting)

Nature:
-ocean flora lacks spreading (barely matters at this point)
-Tangkal tree schem has grass in it.
-freshwater is bad for reservoirs bc of evaporation + nonrenewable, but making it renewable allows infinite water.
-a gemedi cane was spotted on top of moss (flora spread?)

Volcano:
-occassional dark spots

Megamorph:
-a silly string stair doesn't line up (from overpass)
-self.params.share.surface crash with some layouts (that cross over edges. No current morphs do this)
-all doors ought to have floors, to avoid doors hanging in space from caves
-may have redundant and nonfunctional code (due to difficulty of extracting it from source mods)


Tech:
-doors ought to toggle temp_pass group on open and close
-torches/oil lamp should burn when held (i.e. no infinite burn exploit)
-grafitti would benefit from something stopping it on silly things (e.g. beds, crafting spots)
-ropes don't go through air temp
-partly cooked/smelted etc should save progress in meta for inventory (otherwise they can be reset)

illumination:
-Node 'light_source' value exceeds maximum, limiting to maximum: illumination:light_full
-Doesn't illuminate invisible functional non-air nodes (e.g. tree markers)

Artifacts:
-airboat collision allows going into things, dig pointer is out of line with crosshairs, can jump off inside blocks

Crafting (Rubenwardy)
-crafting when full inventory should drop crafts that don't fit inventory.
-adds stack to inventory at crafted stack size, rather than node stack size (over stacked)
-Calling get_connected_players() at mod load time is deprecated
-some items need inv images with space around edges (e.g. wattle)
-sound effects would be nice

Canoe:
-rare: canoe vanished and teleported player a few hundred meters away (while pushing W repeatedly)

Backpacks:
-uses deprecated meta


Multiplayer:
-odd stuck walking in place glitch (when player dying, raining)
-add protection (i.e. locks) to wooden chest and doors


Misc:
-various bits of code could be tidied up (e.g. duplicated code pulled into functions)
-might be missing credit for some textures etc (mostly from Minetest game? plus some plants?)
-a lot of cluttering nodes could be removed from creative inventory
-performance testing etc etc... (can get slow, all the dynamic nature stuff might be a bit much, also large numbers of mobs)
-Irrlicht: PNG warning: iCCP: profile 'ICC PROFILE': 9019A303h: invalid length
-Irrlicht: PNG warning: iCCP: CRC error






IDEAS AND TO DO LIST
--------------------------------------------------------------------


Features needed:
-Rimworld style story-teller (for events, dynamic and unexpected challenges)
- dynamism and decoration for underground city


Features ideas:

--INTERFACE
-remove inventory trash when not creative?
-nameable bags
-help menu

--PROCESSES
-punch with torch for firelighter?
-boil water in pots?
-food decay
-weildview + register wield effects e.g. burn torch

HEALTH
-disease and other player effects
-speed/jump malus from low hp
-more sophisticated health: energy drawn from Hunger.

--NATURE
-bamboo like thing (like canes but for sticks)
-shellfish
-unique environ tolerances for each plant species
-frozen wet ground (cracky)
-fire tolerance for trees (on_burn to charred tree, regenerates)
-seasonal fruit


--MOBS
-more mobs: land predator
-catch chance based on weild item (can catch with hand)
-Rimworld style colonists


--LORE/LOOT/DUNGEONS
-artifacts (loot): scuba, tree grower
-dangerous "pandora's box" loot
-surface ruins
-geomoria decorations
-more morphs: gardens, waste dumps, public baths, transporter room, laboratory, storage dumps, factories
-NPCs, quests etc
-currently looking for loot is a bit gambling/grindy. Doesn't have the right feel for the game.
Going into the lost city needs to feel like a terrifying bad idea. Searching through the junk of
a people who destroyed themselves should also be a dubious/bad idea.
-dangerous contaminants, traps etc

--SOFT PERMA-DEATH i.e. new life = new character
-random (re)spawn location. With settings (e.g. multiplayer spawn needs to be same place)
-random character skins for each life
-acquired character traits (see each life becomes meaningfully unique)
-Death screen - name and days survived (also put in Breaktaker, maybe a Highscores page?). Give name to bones meta.
-multiplayer protection that allows protection to fade after death?? might get abused?
-character page with: days survived, character biography, achievements, nickname

--CLOTHING:
-speed effects (likely to cause issues with bed physics)

--TECH
-more sophisticated fires: heat and output controlled by airflow
-more graffiti in more colors
-inventory on canoe
-wood shingle roof, wood walls, beams etc
-cooking: e.g  juice (fermented)? soup? Stim drug
-tool repair and modifiers
-climbing pick?
-chair (small bed rest effect, but better for crafting)
-sailing
-glassware (windows, bottles, distillery, solar still)
-compost
-bellows that displaces air_temp nodes
-Scyth
-a use for broken pottery,
-ash crafts (glass)
-watering can (make soil wet)
-pottery wheel and more sophisticated glazed pottery
-iron doors (e.g. for furnaces, nonflammable)
-automation (via cogs, gears, windmills etc)
-ranged weapons
-armor

--DECO
-more ambience: rustling leaves, lava
-cave flora (mud with mushrooms)

--MULTIPLAYER
-various standard server tools (e.g. protection, chat, etc)
-signs, letters, etc (graffiti could have an alphabet paint kit, but servers need more detailed signage)
- intro page (optional - off in single player)
- multiplayer only crafts (e.g. for trade). (optional - off in single player)
