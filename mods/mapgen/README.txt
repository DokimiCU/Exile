Humidity divides major ecosystem types between abundant and hostile.
Rich areas are wet, lifeless ones dry. e.g. Forests (wet), dunelands (dry).

Heat divides ecosystem subtypes between dense and open.
Dense areas are cold, open are hot. e.g. woodland (hot) vs forest (cold).

Altitude divides main biomes into Coastal, Lowland, Upland types
