### Gameplay Guide
Many different strategies might work, and part of the fun is figuring out what does,
and catastrophically does not, work.

Here are some early steps you might pass though:
1. Make basic tools, and a bag. Find a suitable camp site.
2. Build a bed to rest in, shelter, and maybe fire for warmth.
3. Make a kiln, and make pots. Harvest wild foods while you wait.
4. Collect water with pots, and build up a water supply.
5. Farm food, drugs, and fibre to build up supplies.
6. Explore and gather resources for more advanced tools.

You start in spring. Soon the hot dry weather of summer will arrive.
Running out of water, or getting exhausted by the heat is a real risk.
After that will come the sub-zero conditions of winter.
Starvation and freezing are hard to avoid without preparation.


Some tips and tricks:
- Beds are important. If you're exhausted you get hypothermia/heat stroke. Get under shelter in a nice temperature.
- Weather: extremes sap your energy. Like real life, walking around in a snowstorm is a bad idea!
- Temperature. Build a shelter, with a fire place or lots of torches. You can also go underground.
- Go deep enough underground and you might find something....
- Water: you can drink cave drips (click them). Water pots collect rain water, or from wet soil. Some plants, food has water.
- Ovens, kilns, furnaces: build them like you would for real. A fire with access to air, and a chamber that gets heated up.
- Fires. Blocks are hotter. Charcoal is hotter than wood. Fires can be temporarily extinguished by punching them holding sediment.
- iron smelting. This is hard. Needs charcoal.
- Charcoal. Make it like you would for real. A wood fire with no air.
- Food: eat stuff and see if you live! You can catch animals with clubs (right click)
- Drugs: a couple of things have useful effects.
- Not every step in crafting can be done at a work station. Some things need to be fired, or soaked in water etc.
- Build stairs and shelters around your base, this will save you energy and protect you from extremes.
